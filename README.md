# Hand Tracking using Mediapipe and OpenCV(Python 3.10)

This project demonstrates hand tracking using the Mediapipe library and OpenCV. It captures video from the camera, detects hand landmarks using Mediapipe, and overlays them on the video feed in real-time.

## Libraries Used
- OpenCV: For capturing video from the camera and processing frames.
- Mediapipe: Provides hand tracking functionality, including detecting hand landmarks.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
"""
git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
"""
2. Install the required libraries using pip3:
"""
pip3 install opencv-python mediapipe
"""

## Usage
1. Run the `main.py` script:
"""
python3 main.py
"""
2. Position your hand in front of the camera.
3. The program will detect your hand landmarks and overlay them on the video feed.
4. Press 'q' to exit the program.
